So in nowdays everything is becoming automated and everyone is looking for the new products to made the life easier.

In our project the main aim is to design and develop the system which is capable of monitoring the passanger's existance and Heat Monitoring and Displaying.
## Used components
 * Temperature sensor
 * switches
 * display
 * led for indication
 * potential Switch
 * resister
## Features
 * If the passager in side the car than switch is ON
 * Passanger was existed in the vehicle it will gives the indication
 * After the indication it will determine the heat.
 * Driver and the passanger can have the access to modifying the temperature in the vehicle.
 * The passanger can modify the temperature by watching the display as the display is given in the system
 * Modular Based Programming
