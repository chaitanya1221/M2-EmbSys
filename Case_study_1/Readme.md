### Ultrasonic sensor
* Ultrasonic agriculture sensors can be used to monitor irrigation systems to prevent overwatering and
 underwatering damages crops.
* The Ultrasonic HC-SR04 Sensor Module is a very popular sensor, it used in many applications where measuring distance and detect objects.
* Ultrasonic Sensors measure the distance to the target by measuring the time between the emission and reception.
