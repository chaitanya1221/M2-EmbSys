### Ultrasonic sensor
* Ultrasonic agriculture sensors can be used to monitor irrigation systems to prevent overwatering and
 underwatering damages crops.
* The Ultrasonic HC-SR04 Sensor Module is a very popular sensor, it used in many applications where measuring distance and detect objects.
* Ultrasonic Sensors measure the distance to the target by measuring the time between the emission and reception.
### Dry/wet sensor
* The dry- wet sensor is a sensor which is set with a threshold value of moisture.
### Servo motor
* A servomotor is an electric motor. It is controlled with the help of servomechanism. A servo motor is an electrical device, that spins the parts of a machine with high efficiency and with great precision.
* Servo motor is a rotary actuator or linear actuator. It allows for precise control of angular or linear position, velocity and acceleration. It consists of a suitable motor coupled to a sensor for position feedback.
### Submersile Motor
* The DC 3-6 V Mini Micro Submersible Water Pump is a low cost, small size Submersible Pump Motor. It operates from a 2.5 ~ 6V power supply. It can take up to 120 liters per hour with a very low current consumption of 220mA. We just need to connect the tube pipe to the motor outlet, submerge it in water, and power it.
### Relay
* Using a 5V Power relay we will control the Water Pump. Whenever the sensor detects a low quantity of moisture in the soil, the motor turns on automatically. Hence, will automatically irrigate the field.
### WiFi Module
* ESP8266 wifi module is used to transmit and receive data.
